                        <h1>MLM</h1>
                        <p class="mt-4">Many companies use many different kinds of strategies and techniques to boost
                            their sales and grow their business. Among many other techniques, one is MLM. MLM is an
                            abbreviation of Multilevel Marketing. In Multilevel Marketing, direct sales companies tell
                            their current product or service distributors to hire new distributors at a percentage of
                            their wages. These new hirees then further recruit more people and create levels of sales.

                        <h1>MLM meaning :</h1>
                        <p class="mt-4">Multilevel marketing is an effective strategy used by companies to dig deep into
                            the market to make profits. As every business is started with hopes of increasing sales and
                            profits every day. MLM is an easy and fast solution of going from no sales to full sales.
                            One should always remember that MLM is not a shortcut to more sales. It is just a simple and
                            effective technique of attracting more customers to your business. Like any other corporate
                            strategy, MLM requires hard work, persistence, and constant efforts to achieve a success
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>It should also be kept in notice that you will hear many people grading MLM as an illegal
                            practice, though it is not illegal. The case is that some similar techniques are illegal,
                            but MLM is different from them in many ways. The illegal tactics for more sales are used by
                            fraudulent companies to gain success overnight. If a company has put its mind to adopting
                            the MLM techniques of generating sales, then they must abide by the rules and regulations of
                            their MLM. Following the legal ways of generating sales and making your employees do so as
                            well, is the best and most authentic way of gaining success as a business. </p>
                        <p>The reason why many companies adopt MLM for their marketing and sales is the rate of
                            flexibility they get to involve more and more people in their business. Due to its
                            simplicity, some companies start thinking MLM to be a do-no-work-and-gain-success kind of
                            practice, which it is not. It demands an equal amount of effort and hard work as any other
                            business strategy would. Once you step on the path of hard work, you are not far from real
                            and authentic success.</p>

                        <h2>What is multilevel marketing?</h2>
                        <p class="mt-4">Multilevel Marketing abbreviated as MLM is a marketing strategy adopted by
                            businesses and companies through which they create levels of distributors. These
                            distributors further recruit more people and give wages to the lower level distributors as a
                            percentage of their income. The people at higher levels of an MLM are given enough money to
                            support themselves and also to pay people on the lower levels than them. Many companies that
                            don't want to employ a huge employee force to sell their products use the technique of MLM
                            for fast and efficient sales of their products and services.</p>

                        <h3>Dynamics of an MLM:</h3>
                        <p class="mt-4">A multilevel marketing structure can to some extent resemble an illegal practice
                            that we will discuss later. But those who have good knowledge can see the difference quite
                            distinctly between the two. MLM is a legal practice that has a network of a different number
                            of employees who are divided into parts. These employees can further have a different number
                            of people based upon the potential of the recruiter. If a recruiter can not afford to pay
                            many people for the sales they make than he only has a smaller part of the level. But if a
                            recruiter generates good money through hard work and patience, then he can hire more people
                            and hence grow his network.</p>

                    <article class="pb-3">
                        <h4>Multilevel Marketing vs. Pyramid Marketing:</h4>
                        <p class="mt-4">One is legal and the other illegal. MLM is a technique adopted and practiced by
                            many businesses worldwide. This technique involves legal ways of selling products and hiring
                            recruiters. But Pyramid marketing is the opposite. It is considered illegal as it makes you
                            put your money into the business to make it grow and hire new people, whereas MLM is just
                            distributing a company's products from larger networks out to the customers or other
                            distributors. This way, MLM brings legal sales to the companies and hence plenty of room for
                            success.</p>
                        <p>Another distinct factor that sets MLM and pyramid marketing apart is the requirement of each
                            level doubling to reach another level in the later. This creates pressure upon people in the
                            lower levels and hence makes pyramid marketing illegal. On the other hand, MLM makes
                            commission-based wages to distributors based on the number of items sold and also of the
                            sales made by people at lower levels.</p>
                        <p>Though it is legal, MLM still makes people ponder a good while before joining it. The sole
                            reason behind it is that MLM brings untested, and new products into the market for sale. It
                            puts people off from joining it, and they also check if the company is reliable enough or
                            not.</p>

                        <h4>Should I join an MLM?</h4>
                        <p class="mt-4">Joining MLMs has been quite effective from ever. People have seen quite
                            significant results in shorter spans of time. Businesses take leaps after having an MLM
                            strategy of making sales. </p>

                        <p>Some benefits of joining MLM are:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Income that flows even when you pause from work: through MLM, you can still be making
                                money if you fall sick or want a break from work. You have lower-level distributors who
                                are always in action to produce more sales. In MLM, it is a rule that you get a
                                percentage of commission for the sales made by people in levels lower than you who are
                                in your network.</li>
                            <li>Low startup costs: not all of us have a divided amount of capital set aside to be spent
                                in business, do we? For such circumstances where you can't afford starting a business
                                single-handedly, you can join an MLM. Here you will have to invest money only as low as
                                $500 and start making sales to earn commissions. This is an efficient way of being firm
                                on your grounds until you get ready to have your own startup business.</li>
                            <li>Discount on products: the company you join for and MLM is sure to provide you discounts
                                on their services and products. These discounts can be up to 20% to 50% and can get
                                topped up based on your relations with the company and your hard work. You can always
                                get the advantages of joining a company you love.</li>
                        </ul>
